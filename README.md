# nvim-configs
A minimal nvim config which includes essential and basic plugins:
lazy.nvim - the plugin manager (bootstrapped)
treesitter - In a nutshell, it's for better syntax highlight and fast performance
telescope - fuzzy finder
lsp (clangd, pyright, lua_ls)
harpoon - file marking and quick navigation (love this)
cmp - for code autocomplete
themes - kanagawa and rose-pine included
colors - to configure the colorscheme as you please (the one here is a function removes the background just how i like it)
keymaps - bunch of keymaps for telescope, harpoon and other stuff (these keymaps are my likings you can modify and add as you wish)
