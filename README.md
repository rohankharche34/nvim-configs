# nvim-configs
A minimal nvim config which includes essential and basic plugins: <br>
lazy.nvim - the plugin manager (bootstrapped) <br>
treesitter - In a nutshell, it's for better syntax highlight and fast performance <br>
telescope - fuzzy finder <br>
lsp (clangd, pyright, lua_ls) <br>
harpoon - file marking and quick navigation (love this) <br>
cmp - for code autocomplete <br>
themes - kanagawa and rose-pine included <br>
colors - to configure the colorscheme as you please (the one here is a function removes the background just how i like it) <br>
keymaps - bunch of keymaps for telescope, harpoon and other stuff (these keymaps are my likings you can modify and add as you wish) <br>
